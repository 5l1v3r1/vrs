You will need Visual Studio 2015 (Update 2 or 3) to build the program. The free
Community version of Visual Studio will work just fine. You can download the installer
for it from here:

## Earlier versions of Visual Studio
You can also use Visual Studio 2013 (or VS2015 pre-Update 2) but you'll need to install
TypeScript 1.8:

* **TypeScript 1.8 for Visual Studio 2013**: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48739
* **TypeScript 1.8 for pre-Update 2 Visual Studio 2015**: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48593
